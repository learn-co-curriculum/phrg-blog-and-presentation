# Blog and Presentation Requirements

## Order

Your blog and presentation preparation can be done in parallel. However, you will likely find it easier to get all your thoughts down in a full first draft of your blog post before tackling your slides & presentation. Get a full grasp on your topic before you jump into making slides.

## Blog

### Content

Your blog post should be on something very specific. Examining just a small technical subset of material allows you to write and speak as an expert on that topic. Avoid writing a post that tries to encompass something *in general*.

The topic can be on anything you have learned so far in the Nitro Developer Bootcamp. The post should be more in-depth than any particular lesson has explained. It also could be on anything related to the content so far, but not explored inside the curriculum itself. Use Ruby documentation for motivation.

Possible blog subject areas include: Ruby inheritance, Modules, refactoring, good OO design, a particular complex set of Ruby methods, a solution you discovered while working on a project, researching error messages and backtraces, etc.

### Requirements

Your blog post needs to utilize code snippets to help explain your topic. These code snippets can be of Ruby or Bash (from you shell session).

Aim towards making your technical blog post about a 2-4 min read. However, more important than length is substance. Your post should be written professionally, as it will not only represent you, but the Nitro Developer Bootcamp and Power Home Remodeling Group at large. When editing your post, make sure that the info is presented in easy to read chunks. Break up long paragraphs into clear digestable pieces of information.

### Logistics

Power hosts a technical blog site called "Tech at Power" at https://blog.techatpower.com/ . This is hosted on the [Medium](https://medium.com/) platform. To add a blog post, you must create a free Medium account if you do not already have one.

You can start your post on Medium. It will save each change you make, and you can publish when you finish. Remember to use upticks to create block and inline code snippets. Medium can be a little contrary with this, but both styles on code snippets do work on their platform. Feel free to include pictures too, but it is optional.

Some online tools that may be helpful are [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) and the [Hemmingway Editor](http://www.hemingwayapp.com).

## Presentation

Before you start building your presentation, [watch this video on giving good technical talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVb2GsJHejo). The accompanying website is [speaking.io](https://speaking.io/). Speaking.io is a superb resource on creating good presentations.

Your presentation will be a "Lightning Talk". Meaning, it will not be a full length technical presentation like the resources above describe. It should just aim to be an informative blurb about 5 minutes in length.

At Power, we use Keynote to create all our slide decks. Although short, your presentation should employ at least 3 different slides of info. Slides must be widescreen (16:9) in size. To change this setting in Keynote, click "Document" in the top right corner, then find the "Slide Size" select bar and choose "Widescreen (16:9)".
