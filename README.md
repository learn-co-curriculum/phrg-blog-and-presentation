# Blog and Presentation Requirements

## Order

Your blog and presentation preparation can be done in parallel. However, you will likely find it easier to get all your thoughts down in a full first draft of your blog post before tackling your slides & presentation prep. Get a full grasp on your topic before you jump into making slides.

## Blog

### Content

Your blog post should be on something very specific. Examining just a small technical subset of material allows you to write and speak as an expert on that topic. Avoid writing a post that tries to encompass something *in general*.

The topic can be on anything you have learned so far in the Nitro Developer Bootcamp. The post should be more in-depth than any particular lesson has explained. It also could be on anything related to the content so far, but not explored inside the curriculum itself. Use Ruby documentation for motivation.

Possible blog subject areas include: Ruby inheritance, Modules, refactoring, good OO design, a particular complex set of Ruby methods, a solution you discovered while working on a project, researching error messages and backtraces, etc.

### Requirements

Your blog post needs to utilize code snippets to help explain your topic. These code snippets can be of Ruby or Bash (from you shell session).

Aim towards making your technical blog post about a 2-4 min read. However, more important than length is substance. Your post should be written professionally, as it will not only represent you, but the Nitro Developer Bootcamp and Power Home Remodeling Group at large.

### Logistics

Power hosts a technical blog site called "Tech at Power" at https://blog.techatpower.com/ . This is hosted on the [Medium](https://medium.com/) platform. To add a blog post, you must create a free Medium account if you do not already have one.

Before you import your post to Medium, create a new Markdown file and use that to create your first draft. Remember to use upticks to create block and inline code snippets. [Markdown to Medium](http://markdowntomedium.com/) is a great tool to change your Markdown into something that Medium will understand.

Wondering how to add images and videos to your post? Google has answers for you :). Your instructor may too, he is learning Medium right now as well.

## Presentation

[Speaking.io](https://speaking.io/) is a superb resource on creating good presentations. You can find the author's (Zach Holman's) "Talk on Talks" [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVb2GsJHejo). Read over that sight and watch Zach's talk to get an idea how to immediately make your presentation better than the majority of talks out there. Your presentation will be what is typically called a "Lightning Talk". Meaning, it will not be a full length technical presentation. It should just aim to be an informative blurb (5 minutes in length).

Although short, your presentation should employ at least 3 slides of info, with no maximum. At Power, we have Macs and thus use Keynote to create these slides.
